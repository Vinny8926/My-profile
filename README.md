## MY JOURNEY IN YEARUP
I remember my first day of the zoom room class as if it were yesterday. I was so nervous and excited as I entered the zoom meeting. I had butterflies in my stomach as I enterd the zoom. I had no idea what to expect.The first thing I noticed was the teachers. They were so friendly and welcoming. They made me feel at ease straight away. I was quickly introduced to other students in the class and we all got along really well.The classes were interesting and challenging. I was given the opportunity to try new things and learn new skills. The teachers were patient and understanding, and always encouraged us to do our best.
